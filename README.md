# packetSenderSim

A program that simulates sending and receiving network packets and allows injecting transmission errors in different ways. A detailed explanation of the simulatorâ€™s operation, architecture, and results is available in my [Undergraduate Thesis](https://github.com/igorFNegrizoli/packetSenderSim/blob/master/TCC_TextoFinal.pdf).

Developed for educational purposes.
